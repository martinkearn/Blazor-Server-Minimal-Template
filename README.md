# Blazor-Server-Minimal-Template
A Visual Studio 2019 template that creates a minimal Blazor Server project with a lot of the example code removed. This includes, but is not limited to removal of the following default artifacts:
- Counter page
- Weather forecast service and page
- Bootstrap
- Ionic
- Most of the markup in `MainLayout.razor` and `Index.razor` 
- Navigation
- Most of the default `site.css`

Some fundamental features are left intact such as the default error pages, a basic layout and a minimal `site.css` as well as the typical `startup.cs` functionality.

What you are left with is a clean, minimal Blazor server project which you can use as a starting point to build you preferred functionality.

This also makes a great template for samples and demos.
